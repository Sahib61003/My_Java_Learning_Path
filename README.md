# My_Java_Learning_Path
This is a repository that documents my journey of learning Java. In this repository, you will find code samples, projects, and notes that I have created while learning Java.

# Getting Started
If you're new to Java, the best way to get started is by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. You can download the latest version of the JDK from the official Java website.
Once you have installed the JDK, you can start writing and running Java programs using a text editor and the command line, or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.

## To run any java file
`javac Filename.java`

`java Classname`
## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to check out my Java learning repository. I hope that you find the contents useful and that they help you on your own learning journey.
